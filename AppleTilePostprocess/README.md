# AppleTilePostprocess

Postprocesses images dumped from the main program using an Xcode GPU Trace to make a grayscale image representing order within a tile
(Dump the mostly red and green input textures from the GPU trace by right clicking on them and choosing export.  Maybe I'll add PNG export to the main program sometime...)
